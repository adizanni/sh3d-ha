Home Assistant Add-on to edit sh3d files in a web interface (using [SweetHome3dJS](https://www.sweethome3d.com/SweetHome3DOnlineManager.jsp)) and export them in the [floor3d-card](https://github.com/adizanni/floor3d-card) format (obj).

It implements the same functionality of [this](https://github.com/adizanni/ExportToHASS) SweetHome3D plugin.

It is still very rudimentary, start to use it in a test environment.
